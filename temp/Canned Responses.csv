Take individual pieces/sections of hair in your hand and slide your fingers directly down the hair.  Apply to damp or dry hair prior to braiding or pony-tails to keep stray hairs together and maintain a smooth, controlled style.  If the hair was styled/finished with Control Paste and a new look is desired, apply blow-dryer heat to hair.  The Control Paste formula will ""melt"" allowing a new shape to take form.  As the hair and product cools, the new shape is set.",,,,,,,

Blow dry hair with a diffuser or allow hair to air dry.",,,,,,,
,,,Foundation Tip,,,"To find your foundation shade, choose colors close to your natural skintone and test on the cheek or jaw line; color should blend invisibly into skin.  For the truest match, test colors in daylight or natural light.  For the most natural effect, apply and blend only where needed, using a sponge.  For a matte finish, dust Inner Light Loose Powder over foundation.",,,,,,,
,,,Hair Styling/Humid Regions,,,"In extremely humid regions, mix a small amount with your favorite Aveda gel to lock out humidity while blow-drying.  Follow with small amounts as needed to finish your style once it's dry.  If you have highly-textured hair and want to slick it back into a pony tail, braid or updo, simply apply Anti-Humectant Pomade to dampen or dry hair and secure tightly with an Aveda pony tail holder.  This keeps humidity in check and frizzies/curly pieces from reforming.",,,,,,,
,,,Hair Styling/Long Hair/Tousled Look,,,"For a tousled look on longer hair, towel dry after washing, and then rough-dry hair with hands and a blow dryer.  When dry, lift sections of hair and spray Air Control evenly through the sections as they slip through your hands. Tease with your fingers.  For an elegant twist, tease hair, spray with Air Control, then smooth with a natural bristle brush.  Pull hair up into a French twist and secure with hair pins.  Finish with another fine mist of Air Control.",,,,,,,
